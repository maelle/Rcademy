#' CORE (Computing Research and Education) lists of conference and journal rankings
#'
#' Two datasets are provided: `core` and `core_journals`, which contains lists of
#' conference and journal rankings respectively, according to the CORE executive committee.
#' These are used in [rank_core()]. The details of the CORE organisation,
#'   and its procedure for ranking is provided below.
#'
#' CORE is an association of university departments of computer science in
#'   Australia and New Zealand. Prior to 2004 it was known as the Computer
#'   Science Association, CSA.
#'
#' The CORE Conference Ranking provides assessments of major conferences in the
#'   computing disciplines. The rankings are managed by the CORE Executive
#'   Committee, with periodic rounds for submission of requests for addition or
#'   reranking of conferences. Decisions are made by academic committees based
#'   on objective data requested as part of the submission process. Conference
#'   rankings are determined by a mix of indicators, including citation rates,
#'   paper submission and acceptance rates, and the visibility and research
#'   track record of the key people hosting the conference and managing its
#'   technical program. A more detailed statement categorizing the ranks A*, A,
#'   B, and C can be found [here](http://bit.ly/core-rankings).

#'      \item{B: good conference, and well regarded in a discipline area}
#'      \item{C: other ranked conference venues that meet minimum standards}
#'     }
